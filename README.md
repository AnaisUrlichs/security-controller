# Misconfiguration Operator for Security Chaos Engineering

## Description

This controller introduces misconfiguration into Kubernetes deployments to test how well your security tooling and processes respond to misconfiguration.

**Philosophy**
Usually, we are waiting around until misconfiguration are introduced into our environments by accident. By using this Misconfiguration Operator, we can intentionally test misconfiguration.
If we test intentionally, we already know
- what went wrong &
- how to fix it

This allows us to build a response pipeline in theory, which is then tested in practice.
Resulting, we can then analyse whether the real response matches our expected response and
- improve our security tooling and processes
- remove unknows and guessing

## Usage Guide
To use the Operator, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster, any Kubernetes cluster should work.

**Install the Operator:**

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnaisUrlichs/security-controller
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

3.. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/controller:tag
```

**Create a Custom Resource**

The Custom Resources is required to define what changes the Operator should take on your deployments. The template looks as follows:
```
apiVersion: api.core.anaisurl.com/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: configuration-sample
spec:
  containerPort: 60
  imageTag: "latest"
  limits: 400
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  requests: 300
  runAsNonRoot: false
  memoryrequests: 80
  memorylimits: 130
```

Modify the template based on the changes that you would like the Operator to make on your deployments. 

Next, apply the Custom Resource to your cluster
```
kubectl apply -f custom-resource.yaml
```

**Set your Deployemnts**

Deployments will only be changed by the Operator if the following annotation is set in the deployment.yaml manifes:
```
metadata:
    annotations:
        anaisurl.com/misconfiguration: "true"
```

The deployment will be changed by the operator once per day for as long as it is running inside the Kubernetes cluster and the deployment has the annotation.

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

At this stage, I do not accept any contributions to this project as this is created as part of my Bachelor Thesis.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## Build and Push a new container image of the Kubernetes Operator

3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-buildx docker-push
```
